                builder who chose to follow what actually interests me, even when
                the easier path was right there. I got into AI in 2025, and once I
                started, I didn't stop. Today I work with 25+ AI tools, I'm doing
                Digital Marketing with AI, and I'm building my own AI products on
                the side.

                I wanted to do a "Digital Marketing with AI" course early on, but I
                couldn't start right away — I had my 12th CBSE boards going on, and
                some family situations made it hard to begin. After I finished 12th,
                my family wanted me to take a different course. But I decided to
                follow what I was actually interested in, so I went ahead and
                completed the Digital Marketing with AI course anyway.

                the idea is that someone can clone a loved one's voice (if they
                have a voice sample) and have a real, emotionally supportive
                conversation with that voice — even live calls, not just text. It's
                meant for people who've lost someone and want a way to feel close
                to them again. The project isn't finished yet — I've paused it for
                now because of funding — but it's something I really care about and
                plan to come back to.
